The data sources used were the Yelp API and the Google API to get the data necessary to find information about different types of restaurants in different cities. There is an API key needed to access the data. I created a secrets.py file with my API keys that I used and used .gitignore to hide this data. To run the program, the user will enter a city and the type of restaurant they want to see. From there, four graphs will pop up from Plotly showing different information about the restaurant types. First is comparing price and rating, then a bar graph of the distances from user, then a pie chart of the restaurant types and finally a histogram of ratings from lowest to highest. If the user wants to see the unit tests, then when the command line pops up, they will be instructed to type ‘exit.’
